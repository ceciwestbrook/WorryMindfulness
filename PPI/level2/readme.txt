This directory contains the template design (fsf) files for level 2 analyses, and a helper script to populate them for all subjects. The purpose of the level2 analyses is to average the two runs together for input into the group-level analyses.

This step was completed more-or-less the same as the level2 step for the GML analyses, with the exception that template files included the additional PPI regressors. Please see details from the higher-level level2 directory for more details.
