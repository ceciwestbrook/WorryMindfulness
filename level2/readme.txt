This directory contains the template design (fsf) files for level 2 analyses, and a helper script to populate them for all subjects. The purpose of the level2 analyses is to average the two runs together for input into the group-level analyses.

This level was complicated to analyze because there were some runs where participants reported ONLY worry (i.e., no successful disengagement trials) or NO worry (i.e., all successful disengagement trials). This meant that any contrasts between successful - unsuccessful disengagement trials had to exclude those runs. This made setting up the feat files annoying for the following reasons:
	1. The 2 runs are averaged together at level 2, so the template file would have to allow for any combination of regular, NOworry or ONLYworry runs. The level1 run names are populated in the file make_fsf_from_template_level2_sepworry.sh.
	2. Any contrasts of successful vs. unsuccessful runs would have to be analyzed separately from the rest of the contrasts (e.g., between disengagement strategies) in order to not have to exclude those participants with NOworry or ONLYworry trials completely. These contrasts are thus pulled out as individual copes in the file make_fsf_from_template_level2_indiv_cope.sh.
	3. To maximize data, we included every possible run to any successful vs. unsuccessful disengagement contrasts. This meant that some participants could only contribute one run to these contrasts. We pulled those individual copes out for those participants and included them on one side of the contrast (for example, if they had ONLYworry, they would be included on the 'unsuccessful disengagement' side of 'successful vs. unsuccessful disengagement.').
	4. The main purpose of level2 is to average 2 runs together. For the successful vs. unsuccessful contrasts, for participants with only one available run, the one usable run was averaged with itself. Thus, we needed template files for _norun1 or _norun2, which are populated in the file make_fsf_from_template_level2_indiv_cope.sh.
