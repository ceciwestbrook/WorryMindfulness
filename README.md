# WorryMindfulness
Data and code for the Worry and Mindfulness project.

This dataset includes limited imaging and additional data from the Worry and Mindfulness study at the University of Pittsburgh, PI Lauren S. Hallion. Included is anatomical data and functional data from the Worry & Mindfulness task. Other tasks and behavioral/clinical data are not included.

 # Task description: # 
Participants provided self-generated worry topics during an interview on a preceding session, which were converted to scanner stimuli. The fMRI task was completed on a subsequent visit, during which they were also instructed in worry disengagement strategies. The task comprised 2 runs of 6 trials each. For each trial, self-generated worry stimuli were presented for 35s, followed by a 35s disengagement period in which participants were instructed to disengage from worry using one of 2 mindfulness strategies (focused acceptance, acceptance) or a control strategy (suppression). Following disengagement, participants responded to thought probes indicating whether they were successful at worry disengagement.

 # Data included: # 
All imaging data was collected on a 3T MRI scanner (MAGNETOM Verio syngo MR B17, 		Siemens Corporation) with a 32-channel radio-frequency (RF) head coil array.

Anatomical 
T1-weighted structural images (1 mm3 voxels) were acquired in the sagittal plane with an isotropic MPRAGE sequence using a parallel imaging factor of 2 (TR=2300, TE=1.97, TI = 900, flip angle = 9ยบ, voxel size = 1mm3, matrix size 256x256).

Functional
T2*-weighted gradient-echo echo-planar images without parallel imaging (TR = 2000, TE = 27.2, flip angle = 79ยบ, voxel size = 3.0x3.0x3.0mm, matrix size 70x70, orientation T>C-30, 51 interleaved slices). Two runs were collected of duration 11m46s (353 volumes; first six subjects) or 12m42s (381 volumes; all remaining subjects).

Fieldmap
Siemens gradient-echo fieldmap sequence (TR = 724, TE 1 = 5, TE2 = 7.46, effective echo spacing = 0.56, phase encode direction A>>P).
