# WorryMindfulness
This is the accompanying analysis code for the Worry and Mindfulness Project, PI Hallion. Please see our preregistration at https://osf.io/tsd74 for more information.

All code and associated documents were written by Ceci Westbrook 2020-2021 unless otherwise noted.

 # Task description: # 
Participants provided self-generated worry topics during an interview on a preceding session, which were converted to scanner stimuli. The fMRI task was completed on a subsequent visit, during which they were also instructed in worry disengagement strategies. The task comprised 2 runs of 6 trials each. For each trial, self-generated worry stimuli were presented for 35s, followed by a 35s disengagement period in which participants were instructed to disengage from worry using one of 2 mindfulness strategies (focused acceptance, acceptance) or a control strategy (suppression). Following disengagement, participants responded to thought probes indicating whether they were successful at worry disengagement.

 # How to use this repository: # 
This dataset was analyzed primarily using FSL's Feat program, which takes design files (.fsf) as input. These files can be batch-edited and submitted, which was the approach used here, following Jeanette Mumford's approach (please see: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB2iAtgpI4YHlH4sno3i3CUjCofI38a-3). The order of use for these scripts are:
 1) Preprocessing using the 0_preprocess script in this directory
 2) level 1 analyses conducted by batch-editing the template .fsf scripts found in the level1/ directory
 3) the same process for level 2 analyses; and finally
 4) group-level analyses utilizing the template scripts in the group_level directory

 # Data included: # 
All imaging data was collected on a 3T MRI scanner (MAGNETOM Verio syngo MR B17, 		Siemens Corporation) with a 32-channel radio-frequency (RF) head coil array.

Anatomical 
T1-weighted structural images (1 mm3 voxels) were acquired in the sagittal plane with an isotropic MPRAGE sequence using a parallel imaging factor of 2 (TR=2300, TE=1.97, TI = 900, flip angle = 9ยบ, voxel size = 1mm3, matrix size 256x256).

Functional
T2*-weighted gradient-echo echo-planar images without parallel imaging (TR = 2000, TE = 27.2, flip angle = 79ยบ, voxel size = 3.0x3.0x3.0mm, matrix size 70x70, orientation T>C-30, 51 interleaved slices). Two runs were collected of duration 11m46s (353 volumes; first six subjects) or 12m42s (381 volumes; all remaining subjects).

Fieldmap
Siemens gradient-echo fieldmap sequence (TR = 724, TE 1 = 5, TE2 = 7.46, effective echo spacing = 0.56, phase encode direction A>>P).
